# Image3D-SceneGraph

Image3D-SceneGraph is a calibration-free image/video/panorama to semantic 3D scene reconstruction project.

The user uploads one image, multiple images, a video, or a 360 panorama. The system estimates scene geometry internally, reconstructs a 3D representation, attaches semantic objects, infers spatial relations, and exposes the result through a web interface.

## Current Scope

This repository is being built as an algorithm-focused computer vision demo, not a generic 3D reconstruction platform.

The first MVP targets:

1. A local job pipeline for image / multi-image / video / panorama inputs.
2. A backend API for upload, reconstruction jobs, result assets, and scene graph JSON.
3. A frontend for upload, progress, 3D viewing, object inspection, and export.
4. A geometry baseline using a modern image-to-3D reconstruction model.
5. Algorithmic additions around scale recovery, semantic 3D fusion, physical consistency, and scene graph reasoning.

## Important Constraints

- Users do not provide camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth, or pose.
- The system may estimate camera parameters internally.
- Do not claim metric accuracy until scale recovery is evaluated.
- Keep model checkpoints, datasets, generated outputs, and debug artifacts out of git.

## Environment

Python dependencies are managed with `uv`.

```bash
uv sync
```

Add dependencies only when the related backend, algorithm, or tooling code is introduced.

## Backend MVP

Start the local API:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Run the backend checks:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run python scripts/smoke_backend.py
```

Current mock API:

- `GET /api/health`
- `POST /api/jobs`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/manifest`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/scene`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/assets/{path}`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/download`

`POST /api/jobs` accepts multipart form data:

- `mode`: `image`, `multi_image`, `video`, or `panorama`
- `files`: one or more uploaded files

`panorama` currently means one equirectangular 360 image. Real panorama reconstruction is not implemented yet; the backend records the mode and returns mock geometry through the same manifest contract.

The MVP writes mock results to `outputs/jobs/{job_id}/`, including `manifest.json`, `geometry/points.ply`, `scene_graph/scene.json`, and `logs/run.log`.

## Development Status

The repository has a project skeleton and a mock backend job API. The next step is to build a frontend viewer against the stable `manifest.json` output contract.
