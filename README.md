# Image3D-SceneGraph

Image3D-SceneGraph is a calibration-free image/video to semantic 3D scene reconstruction project.

The user uploads one image, multiple images, or a video. The system estimates scene geometry internally, reconstructs a 3D representation, attaches semantic objects, infers spatial relations, and exposes the result through a web interface.

## Current Scope

This repository is being built as an algorithm-focused computer vision demo, not a generic 3D reconstruction platform.

The first MVP targets:

1. A local job pipeline for image / multi-image / video inputs.
2. A backend API for upload, reconstruction jobs, result assets, and scene graph JSON.
3. A frontend for upload, progress, 3D viewing, object inspection, and export.
4. A geometry baseline using a modern image-to-3D reconstruction model.
5. Algorithmic additions around scale recovery, semantic 3D fusion, physical consistency, and scene graph reasoning.

## Important Constraints

- Users do not provide camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth, or pose.
- The system may estimate camera parameters internally.
- Do not claim metric accuracy until scale recovery is evaluated.
- Keep model checkpoints, datasets, generated outputs, and debug artifacts out of git.

See [codex.md](codex.md) for the working plan, milestones, and development rules.

## Environment

Python dependencies are managed with `uv`.

```bash
uv sync
```

Add dependencies only when the related backend, algorithm, or tooling code is introduced.

## Development Status

The repository is in the project skeleton stage. The next step is to build a mock backend job API and a frontend viewer against a stable `manifest.json` output contract.
